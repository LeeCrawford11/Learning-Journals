Learning Activities
This week I setup a Static website for a business called AutoGarden, I used what I learned in the lecture videos regarding setting up a AWS account and using the lightsail plugin and some basic features AWS. I also used what I learned from the educational services AWS provides to make the website more functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Estimated Hours
I spent about 3 productive hours of my own time this week on this subject, I'm not including hours spent on a tangent I found myself on because I didn't read the prac details properly .

Content Insights
AWS seems to be a great resource for getting a basic website up and running fast with many plug-ins to add extra functionality that would require a lot of experience in php and html to achieve in other systems.  
Career/Employability/Learning Insights
As its still early in the subject I don't feel comfortable talking in absolutes but after this initial prac, I feel more comfortable in some of the foundational aspects of getting a website hosted. This can only have positive implications, especially for an entry level position in a business with an IT department.
